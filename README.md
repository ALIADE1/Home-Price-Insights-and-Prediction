## Description

This project aims to predict house prices using the **Ames Housing Dataset**, which contains **79 property attributes**. The workflow includes:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Scaling quantitative features  
- Encoding qualitative features  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identifying patterns and relationships in the dataset  

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Transforming and selecting the most relevant features for modeling  

### 4. Model Building
- Developing and evaluating predictive models using techniques like:
  - **Linear Regression**  
  - **Random Forest Regressor**  

### 5. Prediction and Submission
- Generating predictions for the test dataset  
- Preparing results for competition scoring  

This project demonstrates the application of **machine learning** and **data science techniques** to solve a practical problem.
